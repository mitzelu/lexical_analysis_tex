Nowadays, over 31\% of total population are active social media users.\cite{SMResearch} That's why social media are increasingly being used as an information source. Social networking, blogs, dsiscussion forums, wikis, photo-sharing, and video-sharing sites are a few examples of social media chanells. Beside information that thesee channels provide users have the possibility to express their opinion regarding one post by sharing and posting comments.

Throughout the time, social media, became an important business instrument. This not only allows you to better target your audience but it also helps you understand the specific needs of your customer base. Because social media functions best in real-time, it gives you instant access to feedback from your customers. 

In this contex \textbf{blogs} have emerged as an influential new media outlet for PR stories and product reviews. Readers trust third-party blog posts about a company more than statemts from the company itself. Thus, blog posts improve the image of a brand and increase its awareness. A placement in a blog that pecializes on a speific topic guarantees an interested audience. This audience may be smaller than the traditional publicantion, but the level of trust and interest is much greater. 

This fact leads to problem of finding the suitable bloggers by the interested parts. Lexical analysis of social media can reveal bloggers and social media influencers. Since the common mistake in identifying bloggers is focusing on popularity rather than influence, lexical analysis is based on reviewing and analysing the users opinion about the disscused produs (comments), rather than on 
a swarm of shares.

Since YouTube is the number one place for creating video blogs, with can be an incredibly powerful social media marketing tool. The goal is to create a tool which will find the most influence bloggers accroding to a field of interest or keyword. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
